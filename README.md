Super WOW: Such Defense
========================
#### Description
Enemy missiles and assorted space objects are homing onto our beautiful home planet, Earth. With your team of heroic Shibes manning anti-interplanetary ballistic missile sites in orbit, preserve our world as we know it!

Created as as part of the third and final wave of games for a Game Design Practicum course at University of California, Santa Cruz, Super WOW: Such Defense is a re-imagining of the classic game Missle Command. Using the then just released Unity 2D tools, Super WOW attempts to mix up the original formula by making the game an orbital defense game.
